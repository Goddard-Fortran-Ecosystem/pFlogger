Welcome to the pFlogger wiki!

Documentation is sorely lacking.

pFlogger is largely based upon python's [logging](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html) package, but with some very useful extensions for MPI.    Of necessity, some details matter, but with the python documentation and the included examples, enterprising users may be able to get something going on their own.
